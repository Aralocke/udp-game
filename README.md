# UDP Game

This is the basic structure of a UDP based client game.

It's incomplete but I used it as a trial for a few ideas.

## Building

Designed to run exclusively on Windows with C++17. Requires CMake to generate the project.

Build with `make build-debug` or `make build-release` and generate a Visual STudio project with `make proj`.

See the `Makefile` for more infomration.
